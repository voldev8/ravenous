a Codecademy Yelp-like clone.

    Creating Static Components
    Passing Information to Components
    Setting the State of Ravenous Components
    Interacting with the Yelp API

Hereâ€™s a quick overview of how Ravenous should function:

    As a user, I should be able to search for restaurants
    As a user, I should be able to view a list of restaurants returned by the Yelp API
    As a user, I should be able to sort through restaurants using a filter

## Yelp api

In order to run the app, you will need to sign up for yelp api and get a apikey. That key should be put into .env file on the main folder.

In the .env file create a variable,

REACT_APP_YELP_APIKEY="Your Api Key"
